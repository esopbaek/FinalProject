# YourFitnessPal

Fitness journal web-app modeled after MyFitnessPal. It is still a work in progress, but it in the end will 
serve as a calorie counter, food & exercise 
tracker, blogging platform, and social networking site, all featured in one app.
* Backbone app consuming RESTful Rails API
* User is given daily diary pages to record foods eaten and their nutritional content to help hit caloric targets
* The app calculates user-specific daily calorie targets using Mifflin-St. Jeor equations to 
estimate userâ€™s basal metabolic rate based on height, gender, weight, and personal goals
* All CSS rendered by hand from scratch - mostly as an exercise in becoming more competent in css

* Add blogging platform
* jQuery calendar for navigating through diary pages
* Add the ability to create own food for a "MyFoods" page
